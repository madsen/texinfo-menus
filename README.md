Texinfo::Menus
==============

Texinfo::Menus is a Perl module with an associated script that updates
the menus and node links in a Texinfo file based on its chapter
structure.  The file may use `@include` to include other files, which
may also `@inlcude` other files.  Unlike the similar Emacs functions,
Texinfo::Menus does not require that each chapter be in a separate
file.


This is a Git repository where development of Texinfo::Menus
takes place.  For more information, visit
