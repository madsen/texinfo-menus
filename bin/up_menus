=head1 NAME

up_menus - Update node links and menus in Texinfo documents

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<up_menus> [B<-cdv>] FILE

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<up_menus> updates the menus and node links in a Texinfo file based
on its chapter structure.  The FILE may use C<@include> to include
other files, which may also C<@inlcude> other files.  Unlike the
similar Emacs functions, B<up_menus> does not require that each
chapter be in a separate file.

The first node in FILE should be named `Top'.

Each C<@node> command must be followed immediately by a Texinfo
structuring command (e.g, C<@chapter>, C<@section>, C<@appendix>).  A
comment may come between them, but nothing else.

A node can supply a menu description with a comment in the form:

 @c DESC: Menu description



=head1 OPTIONS

=over 5

=item B<-c>, B<--nocomments>

B<up_menus> normally adds comments to the master menu to retain the
descriptions of subsection and lesser nodes.  (This is useful when the
subfiles are automatically generated and the descriptions are added by
hand.)  The B<-c> option prevents this.

=item B<-d>, B<--nodetail>

Normally, B<up_menus> generates a detailed node listing (consisting of
the section nodes for each chapter) following the master menu.  The
B<-d> option omits the detailed node listing.

=item B<-v>, B<--verbose>

The B<-v> option causes B<up_menus> to generate a warning message if
it finds multiple descriptions for a node (only one of which will be
used).

=item B<-?>, B<--help>

Display usage information and exit.

=item B<--version>

Display version number and exit.

=back

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

B<up_menus> requires Getopt::Long 2.17 or later, which is distributed
with recent versions of Perl.


=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

B<up_menus> cannot handle C<@include> inside a menu.
